## Fraud Analytics
- New York Property Tax Fraud Detection.ipynb: build unsupervised fraud detection algorithm to score each property record;
- Credit Card Application Fraud Detection:
  - DQR.ipynb: start the project with a data quality report to understand the data better and have a good sense to create variables;
  - Applications Data DQR.docx: data quality report;
  - Create variables.ipynb: create more than 350 new candidate variables;
  - Feature Selection.ipynb: use univariate filter (using KS score and FDR at 3% score) and backward wrapper methods to select the best 30 variables;
  - Build Model.ipynb: build different models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and other models with tuning different parameters to find the best model.
  - final_report.xlsx: Final report after reruning the final chosen model with training set, testing set and out of time set showing the performance with increment of data records.
