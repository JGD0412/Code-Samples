# Code-Samples
## Machine Learning
- House Price.ipynb: Kaggle Advances Regression Techniques Competition; Predict the unknown house price and try to minimize the RMSE;
- Titanic.ipynb: Kaggle Machine Learning Competition; Predict survival on the Titanic;

## Fraud Analytics
- New York Property Tax Fraud Detection.ipynb: build unsupervised fraud detection algorithm to score each property record;
- Credit Card Application Fraud Detection:
  - DQR.ipynb: start the project with a data quality report to understand the data better and have a good sense to create variables;
  - Applications Data DQR.docx: data quality report;
  - Create variables.ipynb: create more than 350 new candidate variables;
  - Feature Selection.ipynb: use univariate filter (using KS score and FDR at 3% score) and backward wrapper methods to select the best 30 variables;
  - Build Model.ipynb: build different models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and other models with tuning different parameters to find the best model.
  - final_report.xlsx: Final report after reruning the final chosen model with training set, testing set and out of time set showing the performance with increment of data records.

## Integrative Analytics: Project portfolio with four projects
- Restaurant Recommendation.ipynb: build a restaurant recommendation system for group users with Yelp data and user input using deterministic LP to maximize the userâ€™s satisfaction based on their limitations and preferences.
- Multi-location Transshipment with SGD.ipynb: solve a Multi-location transshipment stochastic problem to minimize collective long-run average costs on the premise of allowing transshipment among retailers applying Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).
- Leo-Wyndor Glass.ipynb: start from Linear Regression to fit the model and then use both deterministic linear programming and stochastic linear programming with Sample Average Approximation (SAA) for prescriptive analysis. Finally, validate the solutions by 95% confidence interval.
- COVID19 Ventilator allocation.ipynb: utilize the Simple Recourse model in stochastic optimization with Sample Average Approximation to optimize the allocation of ventilators in the US to fulfill as much demand as we could while saving transportation cost.
